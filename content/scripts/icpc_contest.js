Interestingly, one of the members of <em>Hell Hunt</em> is participating remotely, joining in their team members (and the inviligators) over a Zoom call.<br><br>
    To preserve the integrity of the contest, the judges have removed the keyboard of Hell Hunt's onsite representatives. Teams are only allowed to use one keyboard and use one computer (so all coding and debugging must be done on the one machine) so teams have to be efficient with their time on the computer. To help with this, teams are able to print out their code by copying their code onto a USB provided by our volunteers. Our volunteers then run this print job for them. The teams can then debug their code on paper, freeing up the computer to be used by another team member.
    <br><br>
    Since <em>Hell Hunt</em> do not have this luxury of taking turns on the keyboards, their only strategy is for the onsite team members to communicate their ideas and strategies over to their remote team mate to implement and submit. This is extremely impressive in itself, not withstanding that they are coming first.

    1. Hell Hunt<br>
    2. Arts Students<br>
    3. AnIsDa

    During the last hour, all these teams have made additional submissions so the top three spots could still go either way. Hell Hunt have made two more submissions to their remaining two problems. If they manage to solve these two problems, they would have solved the full set of problems. Arts Students have also made submissions to all the remaining problems, so either Hell Hunt or Arts Students have the chance of taking the top spot if these submissions are successful.
    <br><br>
    AnIsDa have two unsolved problems, and made submissions to problem H but not F. For them to qualify for the World Finals, this submission needs to be successful whilst Hell Hunt's two remaining submissions needs to be unsuccessful.<br><br>

    Either way, Arts Students are almost certain to make the World Finals. The only way this could change is if the next ranked team solves over four problems in the last few minutes. The remaining World Finals spot could still go to either the two UNSW teams.`
